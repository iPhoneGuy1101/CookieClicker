# CookieClicker

UPDATED COOKIE CLICKER!!!
--Now the below features are (close enough too) perfected!
1. Clickable Cookie (lol day 1)
2. Shop stored in JSON Object
3. document.cookie (Save Data) working 99% of the time

# --Known Bugs (email me more, johnj1101@outlook.com)
1. If you buy something from the shop and close the game, save data may bug out! Backup Backup Backup!
2. It is easy to modify document.cookie because all I did was base64 encode some variables.
3. Running cookie.cpc=Infinity (or cookie.cookies/cookie.cps) gives you Infinite cookies (Good job. You have wrecked the fun. Actually, should I add acheivements?)
4. Clicking load data then cancel is an insta-reset (Where da confirmation at?)

Report any bugs you experience while playing, especially right after an update (Adding version numbers, bottom of page)!
